- Streamlit Dashboards
  - Student Churn Predictor: [Student Churn Predictor](https://github.com/maddyrm994/student-churn-predictor)
    - A machine learning project to predict student churn (dropout) based on academic, demographic, and engagement data. The Student Churn Predictor leverages data science and machine learning to forecast which students are likely to discontinue their studies. By analyzing multiple factors, the model provides actionable insights for retention strategies.
    - Demo: [Live App](https://student-churn-predictor.streamlit.app)
  - Store Shelf Product Detector: [Store Shelf Product Detector](https://github.com/maddyrm994/store-shelf-product-detector)
    - Detecting and Identifying Products in Store Shelfs using Deep Learning and Vector Database. This project leverages a custom-trained model (improved version of YOLO) for object detection, USEARCH for vector database, and ResNet/CLIP/DinoV2 for image similarity and retrieval, providing an interactive Streamlit web interface for users.
    - Demo: [Live App](https://store-shelf-object-detector.streamlit.app)
  - Restaurant Order Predictor: [Restaurant Order Predictor](https://github.com/maddyrm994/restaurant-order-predictor)
    - A machine learning project to predict restaurant order patterns based on historical sales, weather, and contextual data. The Restaurant Order Predictor leverages data science and machine learning to forecast restaurant orders. By analyzing multiple factors, the model provides actionable insights to support demand planning and enhance customer satisfaction.
    - Demo: [Live App](https://restaurant-order-predictor.streamlit.app)
  - AI Chatbot: [AI Chatbot](https://github.com/maddyrm994/maddys-chatbot)
    - A simple chatbot for friendly chat purposes. This chatbot can answer any question asked in any language using natural language processing (NLP) and other AI techniques to understand user input and generate appropriate responses.
    - Demo: [Live App](https://maddys-chatbot.streamlit.app)
  - Indian Stock Market Expert: [Indian Stock Market Expert](https://github.com/maddyrm994/indian-stock-market-expert)
    - An expert app which shows live stock market information, predicts potential upward trend in stock prices, analyzes particular stocks if asked.
    - Demo: [Live App](https://indian-stock-market-expert.streamlit.app)
  - Data Visualizer & Analyzer: [Data Visualizer & Analyzer](https://github.com/maddyrm994/data-visualization-analyzer)
    - A powerful app which creates visualizations for the uploaded dataset, and then provides insights based on the created visualizations.
    - Demo: [Live App](https://data-visualization-analyzer.streamlit.app)
  - Interactive EDA Tool: [Interactive EDA Tool](https://github.com/maddyrm994/interactive-eda-tool)
    - An app which asks for a dataset, then provides an overview, cleans the dataset, creates visualizations, and generates comprehensive reports.
    - Demo: [Live App](https://interactive-eda-tool.streamlit.app/)
